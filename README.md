# IPTables-Rule-Generator
This is my first project uploaded publicaly.

I always love using IPTables on my devices because I find it reliable and really versatile, unfortunately not everyone likes CLI tools.

I originally had a clunky but functional python script to help streamline generating rules, and decided to make it a HTML page to run localy.

Please not that once I got it functional, I had AI help with the css to add some visual appeal and make my hopscotch scripting human readable.
